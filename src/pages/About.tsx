        Hey, I'm David, a software engineer student based in Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. I'm currently studying at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. Currently I'm working on myself (mentally and physically), learning a lot of programming languages, making and listening to music, and I'm also interested in complex mathematics! I speak Spanish (Native), English (C1) and Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (30/40%).

         Normally on my free time, I enjoy making and listening to music, it's a hobby I'm very passionate about and had some projects see the light of day, you can check them out on my Bandcamp pages! Apart from what I said earlier, I enjoy talking about movies and series, some books, and obviously some video games too. Other topics I can talk about are programming, mathematics, and some other stuff like history, sociology, football, etc... I'm a very open-minded person, so feel free to talk to me about anything! ðŸŒŸ
